# Hanzo Notify — multi-arch Dockerfile.
#
# Builds a static cmd/notifyd binary; runs FROM Distroless's
# static-debian12-nonroot user. Matches the hanzoai/auto image layout
# (sibling service) so K8s manifests can use one set of probes and
# resource limits across both.

# ─── build stage ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Debian-based golang image — git + ca-certificates + tzdata pre-baked,
# no `apk add` against dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org which the hanzo home-lab
# runner can't reach reliably. Adds ~50MB to the build layer (discarded
# at the FROM scratch hand-off so the final image is unaffected).

# GOPROXY=direct: every hanzo/lux/zoo module lives on github.com,
# which the runner reaches fine. proxy.golang.org (Google IP 142.251.x.x)
# isn't reachable from the home-lab runners, but it's also unnecessary —
# `direct` clones each module straight from its source repo. No external
# proxy, no caching layer to debug.
#
# GOSUMDB=off because sum.golang.org sits in the same Google IP range.
# Module integrity comes from go.sum (checked into the repo) and direct
# git verification of the cloned source.

# Cache the module graph first. No credential: every module in this graph is
# served by the public proxy and recorded in the public checksum log, measured
# across the whole graph, so this is a proxy fetch verified against go.sum.
#
# GOPRIVATE above is what made a credential necessary — it means "bypass the
# proxy AND the checksum database", and bypassing the proxy is what sent the
# fetch to github.com needing authentication. The secret was described as
# mount-only, but `git config --global` wrote it to /root/.gitconfig inside this
# layer, where it shipped with the image.

# Scratch — zero base image dependency, zero registry auth, zero attack
# surface. The build stage above supplies ca-certs, tzdata, /etc/passwd
# + /etc/group for the nonroot user. CGO is off so the static binary
# needs nothing else at runtime.
